# ðŸ©º Early-Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction (AI Project)

This project predicts **early-stage diabetes risk** based on non-invasive health indicators using **Machine Learning algorithms**. It uses symptoms and demographic data to classify individuals as **at risk** or **not at risk** of developing diabetes.

## âœ… Overview
The goal of this project is to **predict diabetes risk at an early stage** using **symptom-based features** and **demographic details**. Early detection helps in timely intervention, preventing complications and reducing healthcare costs.

We implemented and compared three models:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest** *(Best performer)*

---

## âœ… Problem Statement
Diabetes affects millions globally. Traditional diagnosis often occurs after disease progression. We need **non-invasive, accurate, and early prediction tools** for preventive healthcare.

---

## âœ… Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Repository â€“ Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/529/early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset)
- **Features:** 16 attributes (Age, Gender, Polyuria, Polydipsia, Sudden weight loss, etc.)
- **Target:** Diabetes risk (Positive/Negative)

---

## âœ… Features
- **Binary classification** (Positive or Negative risk)
- **Data preprocessing** (Encoding, cleaning, splitting)
- **Model comparison** with metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Cross-validation** for stability
- **Visualization**: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Heatmaps

---

## âœ… Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ Data Handling
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ ML Models & Evaluation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â€“ Visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
